## MOTIVATION TO COLLABORATE


### Anticipated projectability

Proposal | Requirements
------------ | -------------
Other scenarios include the use of CustomDIFF by product engineers to gaze at what  other  colleagues  are  customizing. For  instance,  a  feature  enhancement  introduced  in  a  given  product  might  be  promptly  and  directly  incorporated  into other products, without waiting for this enhancement to be promoted as a core asset. | Provide help to design the evaluation of the idea in the new context.
Differences mainly stem from what is being monitored, how is being monitored, and why is being monitored. Customization Analysis is characterized as tracking code changes (what) through pulling/mining data from  code  repositories  (how)  for  SPL  Scoping  (why). | Content in the second column
